Work Experience

Dec 2023 - Jul 2024
Artificial Intelligence Intern Remote, Singapore
Developed 32 Python functions to address specific issues and queries, adhering to best coding practices and robust
testing methodologies.
Spearheaded the development of a solo project, Math Problem Solver, an Al-powered tool featuring data size
reduction, carbon emission estimation, and reduction capabilities, inspired by SIN principles.
Employed Python libraries (Streamlit, NLTK, SpaCy, SymPy) to implement NLP and mathematical solution
capabilities within the tool.
Achieved a 10% to 15% reduction in energy usage for the decarbonized version of the tool compared to the normal
version.
Demonstrated an average data reduction of 3% for the normal version and 23% for the decarbonized version.
Work on this project earned recognition in a IJIN Institution report.
Built a proof-of-concept FAQ chatbot leveraging Python, Langchain, Streamlit to deliver automated responses based
on IIB dataset, showcasing proficiency in NLP and conversational Al development.

Open Source Contribution

Hugging Face Hub (huggingface/huggingface_hub) Aug 2024 - Present
Contributed to enhancing the Hugging Face Hub’s functionality and code quality.
+ Feature addition: Implemented the update_repo_settings function to the HfApi, enabling users to modify repository
settings programmatically (#2502).

+ Code refactoring: Refactored constant imports across the codebase to use module-level access, improving code
maintainability and readability (#2453, #2469, #2489).

Projects
